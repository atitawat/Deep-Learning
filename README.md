# Deep-Learning
  This Repository contains a bunch of notebooks for various deep learning topics. 
  
# This Deep Learning Repository includes :
* *TensorFlow-using-Softmax* : Build a model for image classification of the MNIST dataset using basic approach of TensorFlow.

* *Data Augmentation* : A data augmentation code to randomly transform images for preventing overfitting.

* *Whale-Classification using CNN Keras* : Build a model for predicting whether an image is of whale or not.

* *Facial Detection and Recognition* : Consists of two Codes- First is the basic face detection code which uses haar_cascade method
                                       Second is the *Face Recognition* which is the extended program which usees LBPH recognizer to
                                       recognize faces.

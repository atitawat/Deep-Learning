**NoteBooks for** :

* **TensorFlow-using-Softmax** : Build a model for image classification of the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.

* **Data Augmentation** : A data augmentation code to randomly transform images for preventing overfitting.

* **Whale-Classification using CNN keras** : Build a model for predicting whether an image is of whale or not.

* **Facial Detection and Recognition** : Consists of a basic face detection code which uses haar_cascade method and an extended program which uses LBPH recognizer to recognize faces.
